# 📬 Job Notifications — Daily Placement Digest

**Author:** Duvvu Lakshmi Prasanna
**Lab:** Day 4 — n8n Automation (Lab 4B)
**Tool:** Self-hosted n8n via Docker

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

An automated n8n workflow that runs on a schedule, fetches the latest job and internship postings from Hacker News Jobs RSS feed, summarises them using an AI model (Groq / LLaMA), and delivers a clean daily digest directly to your inbox — no manual searching required.

Targeted specifically at **final-year CSE students in India**, filtering for India-based, Remote, Fresher, and Internship opportunities.

## ⚙️ Workflow Architecture

```
Schedule Trigger → RSS Read → HTTP Request (Groq AI) → Send Email
```

| Step | Node | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Schedule Trigger** | Fires the workflow automatically at a set time |
| 2 | **RSS Read** | Fetches latest 10 job postings from `https://hnrss.org/jobs` |
| 3 | **HTTP Request** | Sends RSS data to Groq (LLaMA 3.1) for AI summarisation |
| 4 | **Send an Email** | Delivers the formatted digest via SMTP to your inbox |

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- n8n running locally at `http://localhost:5678`
- A Groq API key (free tier available at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))
- Gmail account with an **App Password** enabled (for SMTP)

### 1. Start n8n via Docker

```bash
docker compose -f n8n_docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:5678` and complete the first-time setup.

### 2. Import the Workflow

- In n8n UI: click the ☰ menu → **Import from File**
- Select `Job_Notifications.json`
- The workflow loads with all 4 nodes pre-wired

### 3. Configure Credentials

**Groq API (HTTP Request node):**

- Open the HTTP Request node
- Under Headers, replace the `Authorization` value:
  ```
  Bearer <YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY>
  ```

**SMTP Email (Send an Email node):**

- Open the Send an Email node → Credentials → Edit `SMTP account`
- Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
- Port: `587`
- User: your Gmail address
- Password: your Gmail **App Password** (not your regular password)
- Update `fromEmail` and `toEmail` fields to your address

### 4. Set the Schedule

- Open the **Schedule Trigger** node
- Set Mode to **Cron**
- Cron expression: `0 7 * * *` (runs every day at 7:00 AM)
- Timezone: `Asia/Kolkata`

### 5. Activate

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` from Groq | Re-paste your API key. Ensure `Bearer ` prefix is present with a space |
| RSS node returns empty | Feed URL may be temporarily down — substitute `https://news.ycombinator.com/rss` |
| Email not received | Check App Password is correct; ensure "Less secure app access" or App Password is enabled |
| n8n UI not loading | Run `docker logs <container_id>` — check for port conflict, try port `15678` |
| Docker not starting | Open Docker Desktop and wait for the whale icon to stop animating |

## 🚀 Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add a **Slack node** to post the digest to a `#placements` channel
- [ ] Filter results by specific keywords (e.g., "Python", "React", "ML")
- [ ] Add a second RSS source (e.g., LinkedIn Jobs, Internshala RSS)
- [ ] Store results in **Google Sheets** for tracking over time
